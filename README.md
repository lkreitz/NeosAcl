# Sandstorm Neos ACL

This package implements dynamic Access Control Lists for Neos Roles.

The development of this package was sponsored by [ujamii](https://www.ujamii.com/) and [queo](https://www.queo.de). 

Main features:

- Switch `RestrictedEditor` to an allowlist-only permission approach. By installing this package, the `RestrictedEditor` is
  no longer allowed to change any content.
- Configure dynamic roles through a Neos backend module.
- Permissions on the node tree, workspaces and dimensions possible.
- Permissions work predictably with sane defaults and purely additive logic.

## Installation

1. Install the package:

```
composer require sandstorm/neosacl
```

2. Run the migrations

```
./flow doctrine:migrate
```

3. Log in with an admin account and visit the new menu entry 'Dynamic Roles'


## Development 

**Initial (Package) Setup**

- Clone this package as `Sandstorm.NeosAcl` in the DistributionPackages of a Neos 4.3 or later installation
- Add it to `composer.json` as `"sandstorm/neosacl": "*"`
- Run `composer update`
 
**Initial React Setup**

```
cd Resources/Private/react-acl-editor
yarn
yarn dev
```

Then, log into the backend of Neos, and visit the module "Dynamic Roles".


### Internal Implementation Details

#### Implementing Dynamic Node Privileges and MethodPrivileges

The basic idea was the following: Hook into `PolicyService::emitConfigurationLoaded`, and modify the `$configuration` array (introduce new roles
and privilegeTargets). This basically works **at runtime** - however there is a problem with dynamic MethodPrivilege enforcement, which is
explained below and by the following diagram:

![Concept](./Documentation/DynamicMethodPrivileges.svg)

#### How do Method Privileges work

- Background: An implementation of `PointcutFilterInterface` can - during compile time of Flow - decide which classes
  and methods match for a certain aspect.
  - This is used in `PolicyEnforcementAspect` (which is the central point for enforcing **MethodPrivileges**).
  - There, the `MethodPrivilegePointcutFilter` is referenced.
  - The `MethodPrivilegePointcutFilter` asks the `PolicyService` for all configured `MethodPrivilege`s - and ensures
    AOP proxies are built for these methods.
- **Side Effect**: Now, during building up the pointcut filters, the `MethodPrivilegePointcutFilter` **additionally** builds up
  a data structure `methodPermissions` - which remembers which `MethodPrivileges` are registered for which method.
  - This data structure is stored **persistently in the `Flow_Security_Authorization_Privilege_Method` cache**.
  - At runtime, for a class which is intercepted by `PolicyEnforcementAspect`, all configured `MethodPrivilege`s are
    invoked - and they have to quickly decide if they match **this particular call-site**.
  - This is done using the `methodPermissions` data structure from the `Flow_Security_Authorization_Privilege_Method` cache.

#### What's the problem with dynamically added MethodPrivileges

- If a `MethodPrivilege` is defined dynamically at runtime, then the `methodPermissions` data structure is missing
  the information that this new privilege should be invoked for certain methods.
- NOTE: You can only dynamically add `MethodPrivileges` for call-sites **which are already instrumented by AOP**;
  because otherwise the code will never get invoked (because of missing proxies).

We are mostly working with `EditNodePrivilege` etc. - so why does this apply there?

- `EditNodePrivilege` has an internal `MethodPrivilege` **which takes care of the method call enforcement part**;
  i.e. preventing you to call e.g. `NodeInterface::setProperty()` if you do not have the permission to do so.

Furthermore, to make this idea work, the `Policy.yaml` of this package defines a catch-all `Sandstorm.NeosAcl:EditAllNodes`
PrivilegeTarget - so AOP will instrument the corresponding methods of `NodeInterface`. This catch-all makes sense
in any case, because this switches the security framework [to an allowlist-only approach](https://docs.neos.io/cms/manual/backend-permissions/real-world-examples#user-rights-for-part-of-a-page-tree](https://docs.neos.io/cms/manual/backend-permissions/user-rights-in-page-tree)
- making it easier to grasp.

#### The goal

In order to make the dynamic policy enforcement work, we need to add custom stuff to the `methodPermissions` - for
the dynamically added roles.

#### Implementation

The post-processing of the `methodPermissions` is done using a custom cache frontend (`SecurityAuthorizationPrivilegeMethodCacheFrontend`).

#### Implementing dynamic AOP Runtime Expressions

Method privileges internally can use dynamic AOP Runtime Expressions (in case you check for method parameters). Especially
the `MethodPrivilege` - which is attached to the `RemoveNodePrivilege` - uses the following expression code:

```php
return 'within(' . NodeInterface::class . ') && method(.*->setRemoved(removed == true))';
```

The `removed == true` part is a so-called *AOP Runtime Expression*. 

This is internally implemented using the `Flow_Aop_RuntimeExpressions` "cache", which is pre-filled again during the compile
time (which is a nasty side-effect).

Thus, in our case we need to again implement a custom cache frontend (`AopRuntimeExpressionsCacheFrontend`),
using the runtime expressions of the base configuration, which exists properly.
